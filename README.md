# 🥔 Super Potato is a simple weather app

## 🎯 Goal

- It is a simple weather app that (for now) just shows the current weather.

## 🥔 Why super potato?

🥔 I would like to take credit for such a great name but it is in fact a GitHub suggestion 🙏. Whilst not very descriptive, for the sake brevity, I stuck with it and now quite like it. 🥔
